### Homework 2 Error Explanation

I was having issues since last week with HW2 and I did put in alot of time and also stayed after classess to get helped. One porblem gets sorted and then I'd get another one. 

When I ran ./gradlew bootRun I though the last line should've had 100% but then Carson explained to me that <==========---> 80% EXECUTING [46s] means it is running. 

*** Am getting "HTTP Status 404 â€“ Not Found" ***
Resolved 404 error. I was connected to the wrong databse I was using wrong port. Also on the url I had to add /OpenTrainer... before /session.
