For homework 3 I just created the branch I did the actual assignemt while doing homework 2. 
I would even say that spotless work too well because some of the packages I import are automatically remove when saved.

Unfortunately I still cannot run them though one of my classmate was kind enought to test them for me. And it does work of theirs. Which is good news.
